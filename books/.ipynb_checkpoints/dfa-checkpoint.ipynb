    "> In theory of computation, a branch of theoretical computer science, a deterministic finite automaton (DFA)—also known as deterministic finite state machine—is a finite state machine that accepts/rejects finite strings of symbols and only produces a unique computation (or run) of the automaton for each input string.\n",

    "An automaton, very generally it is an abstract machine. It is the idea of a machine with very specific things in mind. The DFA is a machine which exists in states. A DFA representing a fan may be either in the \"off\" state or \"on\" state. A DFA representing a clock may have 12 states representing the hours or many more if it has minutes and hours and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The point being that a DFA is an abstract machine consisting of states. Every time this machine receives an input, it transitions from the current state to another. This other state may be the same as the previous one though. The next input causes it to transition again. The inputs are called **symbols**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sequence of inputs is generally called the input string (as in, a string of symbols). Thus the DFA is said to run on an input string; meaning it changes it's internal state as and when the input symbols are provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules for transition are provided in the transition function which is usually denoted by $\\delta$ (we will come back to this later). Since the DFA must initially be in some state before receiving any input, a single state is marked out for this use called the starting state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the input string is complete, the state the DFA is in is recorded. If this state is one of a select few states, the DFA is said to *accept* the string. One must take note about the usage of the word *accept*. We have designed this DFA to accept or reject input strings. It is be design that a DFA will accept or reject some string."
