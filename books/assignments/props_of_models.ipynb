    "    - All the different types of models we have seen, represent something in the world.\n",
    "    - Their representation is an approximation of the real thing.\n",
    "    - As a result, some parts of the model will not be accurate\n",
    "    - The parts which are not representative are usually selected to be meaningless to the model user.\n",
    "    - For example: A Scale model of the building is not usually made of the same materials as the actual building since the purpose of the model is to represent scale\n",
    "    - Every model has error, a good model has negligible error making it useful\n",
    "2. Models are **made using something**.\n",
    "    - All models themselved must be constructed.\n",
    "    - Some are made using physical materials, like Scale models\n",
    "    - Some are made using language, like Mathematical models being suually made out of Set theory\n",
    "3. Models are **useful**\n",
    "    - All models are made in order to be useful\n",
    "    - They may help us understand the thing they represent better.\n",
    "    - They may help us prredict the behaviour of the things they represent\n",
    "    - They may also, be used to verify theories by testing their predictions against observed phenomenon.\n",
